# Image-steganography
Stego Malware is a type of malware that uses Steganography to prevent detection. During this work, we studied various attacks based on Image Steganography on Computer Systems and Smartphones. Hammertoss is one of the images of stego malware that was read and selected for use. is a Firewall that protects against Trojan Trojan (RAT). based on the above, educating and proposing the various methods available to prevent and detect stego-malware. New suggestions associated with stego malware prevention include, a program based on digital signature of guaranteed applications and a powerful Warden attack scheme on downloaded StegoImages. existing image-based malware detection techniques include malware detection techniques and image steganalysis techniques. By combining these existing processes, a way to find a smart class for all types of stego malware is proposed. And after studying many of Steganalysis's strategies, two new Spatial Domain Image Steganalysis strategies are proposed, implemented and analyzed.
